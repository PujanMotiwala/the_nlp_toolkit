# Introduction to The_NLP_Toolkit

Welcome to **The_NLP_Toolkit**. This document provides an overview of the various NLP techniques covered in this repository. Each technique is accompanied by practical examples and detailed explanations to help you understand and implement them in your projects.

## NLP Techniques

### Text Preprocessing
Text preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing text data for analysis. This includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

#### Example
```python
from src.text_preprocessing import preprocess_text

sample_text = "Natural Language Processing with Python is fun and exciting!"
preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(sample_text)
print(preprocessed_text)
```

### Text Representation
Text representation involves converting text into numerical vectors. Common methods include Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.

#### Example
```python
from src.text_representation import get_bag_of_words, get_tfidf

documents = [
    "Natural Language Processing is fun.",
    "Machine Learning is fascinating.",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning."
]

print("Bag of Words:\n", get_bag_of_words(documents))
print("TF-IDF:\n", get_tfidf(documents))
```

### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis determines the sentiment expressed in a text, often as positive, negative, or neutral.

#### Example
```python
from src.sentiment_analysis import analyze_sentiment

sample_text = "Natural Language Processing with Python is fun and exciting!"
sentiment = analyze_sentiment(sample_text)
print("Sentiment Analysis:\n", sentiment)
```

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and classifies named entities in text, such as people, organizations, and locations.

#### Example
```python
from src.ner import named_entity_recognition

sample_text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion."
entities = named_entity_recognition(sample_text)
print("Named Entities:\n", entities)
```

### Summary

- **Folder Structure**: Organized to separate core functionality (`src/`) and examples (`examples/`).
- **Documentation**: Centralized in `docs/introduction.md`.
- **New NLP Techniques**: Added NER with examples.
