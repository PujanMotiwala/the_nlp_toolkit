## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. This toolkit covers a broad spectrum of NLP techniques, from basic text preprocessing to advanced deep learning models.

## Techniques

We cover the following techniques:

1. Text Preprocessing
2. Text Representation
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Text Classification
5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
6. Text Summarization
7. Machine Translation
8. Question Answering
9. Text Generation
10. Topic Modeling

## Usage

Use this repository to:

- Learn about different NLP techniques and their applications.
- Experiment with various NLP models and methods.
- Apply NLP techniques to your own projects.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PujanMotiwala/The_NLP_Toolkit.git
cd The_NLP_Toolkit
```
Install the required dependencies:

```bash

```
## Examples

We provide several example scripts demonstrating the use of different NLP techniques. You can find them in the examples directory.

Here’s how you can run an example:

```bash
python examples/example_script.py
```

Each example script includes a detailed explanation and results analysis.
